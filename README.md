# Data-Acquisition-And-Filtering-Using-FPGA
Interfaced PMOD light and pressure sensors with a Zynq-7000 series FPGA via the SPI protocol and designed a Kalman Filter and Median Filter using Verilog on Xilinx Vivado to filter noise from sensor data. Utilized a Virtual I/O module to compare filtered vs raw sensor data.
